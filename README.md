# projecttemplate

Group Members: Nico Stuart

Project idea: Work through various coding challenges while acquiring new skills. I'm hoping to work on a looser schedule, and just aim to do approximatley 6 hours of work every day. I think a reasonable goal to add some structure is to complete one of each of the following challenges every day:
  Advent of Code,
  Codewars,
  Oppen Kattis,
  Codeforces,
  Euler Project,
  
Keep in mind that I'm writing this schedule only after trying Project Euler and Advent of Code, so if one of those is unusually difficult, I may spend longer on those challenges.

If this seems too honor system-y please let me know and I can create some harder guidelines.
